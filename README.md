# AI-Benchmark

## Content

The AI-Benchmark contains eight systems from process engineering which can be used for evaluating AI methods for fault handling in CPPS. The systems are simulated in Modelica.

## Developers

The AI-Benchmark has been developed by the Machine Learning group of Fraunhofer IOSB-INA. Fraunhofer IOSB-INA is the Industrial Automation Branch of Fraunhofer IOSB, located in Lemgo, Germany (https://www.iosb-ina.fraunhofer.de/en/divisions/Machine-Learning.html).

## How-To
There are two possible ways to run the simulation:

(1) You already have a Modelica Compiler installed. Then you can either run each simulation individually or all together using the python script.

(2) You have no Modelica Compiler installed yet. Then you can build the docker image and run a container. Inside the container, the OpenModelicaCompiler is installed and all simulations are run.
